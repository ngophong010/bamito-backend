# BAMITO - Badminton E-commerce Backend API üè∏

This repository contains the complete backend API for the BAMITO e-commerce platform. It is a modern, scalable, and secure RESTful API built with Express.js, TypeScript, and Sequelize, following a professional **API-First design methodology**.

The entire API is documented using an **[OpenAPI 3.0.0 Specification](#-api-documentation)**, which serves as the single source of truth for the application's functionality.

## ‚ú® Core Features & Architecture

This project was built from the ground up with a focus on modern, professional backend principles.

-   **API-First Design:** The API contract was designed and documented in OpenAPI before implementation, enabling parallel development and a clear, predictable structure.
-   **RESTful Architecture:** Follows REST principles with resource-oriented endpoints, proper use of HTTP verbs, and standard status codes.
-   **Fully Type-Safe:** Built entirely with **TypeScript** to ensure type safety, reduce bugs, and improve the developer experience.
-   **High-Performance Database Schema:** Uses a robust **PostgreSQL** database with an efficient schema designed around **integer primary keys** and proper indexing for fast joins and high performance.
-   **Transactional Integrity:** All critical multi-step operations (like creating an order) are wrapped in **Sequelize transactions** to guarantee data atomicity and prevent corruption.
-   **Robust Security:**
    -   **Authentication:** Secure JWT (Access & Refresh Tokens) flow implemented in `httpOnly` cookies.
    -   **Authorization:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with a clean `protect` -> `isAdmin`/`isOwner` middleware pattern.
    -   **Input Validation:** All incoming requests are validated and sanitized using `express-validator` to prevent bad data and common vulnerabilities.
    -   **Security Headers & Rate Limiting:** `Helmet` and `express-rate-limit` are used for an extra layer of protection.
-   **Separation of Concerns:** A clean, scalable folder structure that strictly separates logic into Routers, Controllers, Services, and Models.

## üìñ API Documentation

This API adheres to an **API-First** workflow. The complete and interactive documentation, generated from the OpenAPI specification, serves as the single source of truth.

**The full specification can be found in the `/docs` directory.**

You can use a tool like the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or a VS Code extension to view the `docs/openapi.yaml` file for an interactive experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
-   npm or yarn
-   A running **PostgreSQL** database instance.
-   [Sequelize CLI](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/other-topics/migrations/#installing-the-cli) installed globally:
    ```sh
    npm install -g sequelize-cli
    ```

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ngophong010/bamito-backend.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd bamito-backend
    ```

3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    -   Create a copy of the example environment file.
        ```sh
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    -   Open the newly created `.env` file and fill in all the required values (database credentials, JWT secrets, etc.). See the table below for details.

5.  **Create the database:**
    -   Connect to your PostgreSQL instance and run:
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE bamito_dev;
        ```

6.  **Run the database migrations:**
    -   This will create all the necessary tables in your database.
        ```sh
        npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
        ```

7.  **Run the database seeders:**
    -   This will populate the database with essential foundational data (roles, brands, etc.).
        ```sh
        npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
        ```

8.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

The API server should now be running at `http://localhost:8080`.
